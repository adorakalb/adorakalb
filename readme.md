### Hello there! 😉

**IMPORTANT!**  I've moved away from Github and my projects are now at https://codeberg.org/lauralani and https://git.lauka.net/lauralani. See https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/jun/30/give-up-github-launch/ for the reasons as to why I left GitHub.

Hi I'm Laura, a german Network Engineer and Developer!

I'm looking to deepen my C# and Azure knowledge and grow more into getting proficient with Infrastructure and Network as Code.
